    > **Note**: You also need to install the Dac Framework which is used by the application you will be deploying later in the lab.

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to **az40011bvm**, start a web browser, navigate to the [Microsoft SQL Server Data-Tier Application Framework (18.2) download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58207&WT.mc_id=rss_alldownloads_extensions). This will automatically trigger the download.
1.  Once the download of the **DacFramework.msi** file completes, use it to run the installation of the Microsoft SQL Server Data-Tier Application Framework with the default settings.

#### Task 2: Configure a release pipeline

In this task, you will configure the release pipeline.

> **Note**: The Azure VM has the agent configured to deploy the applications and run Selenium testcases. The release definition uses **[Phases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/process/phases)** to deploy to target servers.

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to **az40011bvm**, in the browser window displaying the **Azure DevOps** portal, click the **Azure DevOps** symbol in the upper left corner.
1.  On the pane displaying your organization projects, click the tile representing the **Setting Up and Running Functional Tests** project.
1.  On the **Setting Up and Running Functional Tests** pane, in the vertical navigational pane, select **Pipelines**, within the **Pipelines** section, click **Releases** and then, on the **Selenium** pane, click **Edit**.
1.  On the **All pipelines > Selenium** pane, click the **Tasks** tab header and, in the dropdown menu, click **Dev**.
1.  Within the list of tasks of the **Dev** stage, review the **IIS Deployment**, **SQL Deployment**, and **Selenium test execution** deployment phases. 

- **IIS Deployment phase**: In this phase, we deploy application to the VM using the following tasks:

   - **IIS Web App Manage**: This task runs on the target machine where we registered agent. It creates a *website* and an *Application Pool* locally with the name **PartsUnlimited** running under the port **82** , [**http://localhost:82**](http://localhost:82)
   - **IIS Web App Deploy**: This task deploys the application to the IIS server using **Web Deploy**.

- **Database deploy phase**: In this phase, we use [**SQL Server Database Deploy**](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/blob/master/Tasks/SqlDacpacDeploymentOnMachineGroup/README.md) task to deploy [**dacpac**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/data-tier-applications) file to the DB server.

- **Selenium tests execution**: Executing **UI testing** as part of the release process allows us to detect unexpected changes. Setting up automated browser based testing drives quality in your application, without having to do it manually. In this phase, we will execute Selenium tests on the deployed web application. The subsequent tasks describe using Selenium to test the websites in the release pipeline.

  - **Visual Studio Test Platform Installer**: The [Visual Studio Test Platform Installer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/tool/vstest-platform-tool-installer?view=vsts) task will acquire the Microsoft test platform from nuget.org or a specified feed, and add it to the tools cache. It satisfies the **vstest** requirements so any subsequent Visual Studio Test task in a build or release pipeline can run without needing a full Visual Studio install on the agent machine.
  - **Run Selenium UI tests**: This [task](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/Tasks/VsTestV2/README.md) uses **vstest.console.exe** to execute the selenium testcases on the agent machines.

1.  On the **All pipelines > Selenium** pane, click the **IIS Deployment** phase and, on the **Agent job** pane, verify that the **Default** Agent pool is selected. 
1.  Repeat the previous step for **SQL Deployment** and the **Selenium tests execution** phases. If needed, click **Save** to save the changes.

#### Task 3: Trigger Build and Release

In this task, we will trigger the **Build** to compile Selenium C# scripts along with the Web application. The resulting binaries are copied to self-hosted agent and the Selenium scripts are executed as part of the automated **Release**.

1.  Within the Remote Desktop session to **az40011bvm**, in the browser window displaying the **Azure DevOps** portal, in the vertical navigational pane, in the **Pipelines** section, click **Pipelines** and then, on the **Pipelines** pane, click **Selenium**.
1.  On the **Selenium** pane, click **Run pipeline** and, on the **Run pipeline**, click **Run**.

    > **Note**: This build will publish the test artifacts to Azure DevOps, which will be used in release. 

    > **Note**: Once the build is successful, release will be triggered. 

1.  On the pipeline runs pane, in the **Jobs** section, click **Phase 1** and monitor the build progress until its completion.
1.  In the browser window displaying the **Azure DevOps** portal, in the vertical navigational pane, in the **Pipelines** section, click **Releases**, click the entry representing the release, and, on the **Selenium > Release-1** pane, click **Dev**.
1.  On the **Selenium > Release-1 > Dev** pane, monitor the corresponding deployment.
1.  Once the **Selenium test execution** phase starts, monitor the web browser tests. 
1.  Once the release completes, on the **Selenium > Release-1 > Dev** pane, click on the **Tests** tab to analyze the test results. Select the required filters from the dropdown in **Outcome** section to view the tests and their status.

### Exercise 2: Remove the Azure lab resources

In this exercise, you will remove the Azure resources provisione in this lab to eliminate unexpected charges. 

>**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

#### Task 1: Remove the Azure lab resources

In this task, you will use Azure Cloud Shell to remove the Azure resources provisioned in this lab to eliminate unnecessary charges. 

1.  In the Azure portal, open the **Bash** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1.  List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

    ```sh
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m11l02-RG')].name" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

    ```sh
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m11l02-RG')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
    ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the --nowait parameter), so while you will be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.


## Review

In this lab, you learned how to execute Selenium test cases on a C# web application, as part of the Azure DevOps Release pipeline.
