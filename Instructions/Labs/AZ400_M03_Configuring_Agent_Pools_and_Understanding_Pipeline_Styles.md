# Lab 04: Configuring Agent Pools and Understanding Pipeline Styles
# Student lab manual

## Lab overview

YAML-based pipelines allow you to fully implement CI/CD as code, in which pipeline definitions reside in the same repository as the code that is part of your Azure DevOps project. YAML-based pipelines support a wide range of features that are part of the classic pipelines, such as pull requests, code reviews, history, branching, and templates. 

Regardless of the choice of the pipeline style, to build your code or deploy your solution by using Azure Pipelines, you need an agent. An agent hosts compute resources that runs one job at a time. Jobs can be run directly on the host machine of the agent or in a container. You have an option to run your jobs using Microsoft-hosted agents, which are managed for you, or implementing a self-hosted agent that you set up and manage on your own. 

In this lab, you will step through the process of converting a classic pipeline into a YAML-based one and running it first by using a Microsoft-hosted agent and then performing the equivalent task by using a self-hosted agent.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- implement YAML-based pipelines
- implement self-hosted agents

## Lab duration

-   Estimated time: **45 minutes**

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This will be installed as part of prerequisites for this lab.

#### Set up an Azure DevOps organization

If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops).

### Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites

In this exercise, you will set up the prerequisite for the lab, which consists of the preconfigured Parts Unlimited team project based on an Azure DevOps Demo Generator template.

#### Task 1: Configure the team project

In this task, you will use Azure DevOps Demo Generator to generate a new project based on the **PartsUnlimited** template.

1.  On your lab computer, start a web browser and navigate to [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net). This utility site will automate the process of creating a new Azure DevOps project within your account that is prepopulated with content (work items, repos, etc.) required for the lab. 

    > **Note**: For more information on the site, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/demo-gen.

    | Name | **Configuring Agent Pools and Understanding Pipeline Styles lab** |
    | Scope (custom defined) | **Agent Pools** (show more scopes option below if needed)|
    | Permissions | **Read and manage** |

1.  On the **Success** pane, copy the value of the personal access token to Clipboard.

    > **Note**: Make sure you copy the token. You will not be able to retrieve it once you close this pane. 

1.  On the **Success** pane, click **Close**.
1.  On the **Personal Access Token** pane of the Azure DevOps portal, click **Azure DevOps** symbol in the upper left corner and then click **Organization settings** label in the lower left corner.
1.  To the left side of the **Overview** pane, in the vertical menu, in the **Pipelines** section, click **Agent pools**.
1.  On the **Agent pools** pane, in the upper right corner, click **Add pool**. 
1.  On the **Add agent pool** pane, in the **Pool type** dropdown list, select **Self-hosted**, in the **Name** text box, type **az400m05l05a-pool** and then click **Create**.
1.  Back on the **Agent pools** pane, click the entry representing the newly created **az400m05l05a-pool**. 
1.  On the **Jobs** tab of the **az400m05l05a-pool** pane, click the **New agent** button.
1.  On the **Get the agent** pane, ensure that the **Windows** and **x64** tabs are selected, and click **Download** to download the zip archive containing the agent binaries to download it into the local **Downloads** folder within your user profile.

    > **Note**: If you receive an error message at this point indicating that the current system settings prevent you from downloading the file, in the Internet Explorer window, in the upper right corner, click the gearwheel symbol designating the **Settings** menu header, in the dropdown menu, select **Internet Options**, in the **Internet Options** dialog box, click **Advanced**, on the **Advanced** tab, click **Reset**, in the **Reset Internet Explorer Settings** dialog box, click **Reset** again, click **Close**, and try the download again. 

1.  Start Windows PowerShell as administrator and in the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** console run the following lines to create the **C:\\agent** directory and extract the content of the downloaded archive into it. 

    ```powershell
    cd \
    mkdir agent ; cd agent
    $TARGET = Get-ChildItem "$Home\Downloads\vsts-agent-win-x64-*.zip"
    Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem
    [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory($TARGET, "$PWD")
    ```

1.  In the same **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** console, run the following to configure the agent:

    ```powershell
    .\config.cmd
    ```

1.  When prompted, specify the values of the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Enter server URL | the URL of your Azure DevOps organization, in the format **https://dev.azure.com/`<organization_name>`**, where `<organization_name>` represents the name of your Azure DevOps organization |
    | Enter authentication type (press enter for PAT) | **Enter** |
    | Enter personal access token | The access token you recorded earlier in this task |
    | Enter agent pool (press enter for default) | **az400m05l05a-pool** |
    | Enter agent name | **az400m05-vm0** |
    | Enter work folder (press enter for _work) | **Enter** |
    | Enter Perform an unzip for tasks for each step. (press enter for N) | **Enter** |
    | Enter run agent as service? (Y/N) (press enter for N) | **Y** |
    | Enter User account to use for the service (press enter for NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE) | **Enter** |
    | Enter whether to prevent service starting immediately after configuration is finished? (Y/N) (press enter for N) | **Enter** |

    > **Note**: You can run self-hosted agent as either a service or an interactive process. You might want to start with the interactive mode, since this simplifies verifying agent functionality. For production use, you should consider either running the agent as a service or as an interactive process with auto-logon enabled, since both persist their running state and ensure that the agent starts automatically if the operating system is restarted.

1.  Switch to the browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal and close the **Get the agent** pane.
1.  Back on the **Agents** tab of the **az400m05l05a-pool** pane, note that the newly configured agent is listed with the **Online** status.
