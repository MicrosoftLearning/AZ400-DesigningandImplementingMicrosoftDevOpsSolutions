#### Set up an Azure DevOps organization. 

If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops).

### Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites

In this exercise, you will set up the prerequisites for the lab, which consist of the preconfigured **Tailwind Traders** team project based on an Azure DevOps Demo Generator template and a team created in Microsoft Teams.

#### Task 1: Configure the team project

In this task, you will use Azure DevOps Demo Generator to generate a new project based on the **Tailwind Traders** template.

1.  On your lab computer, start a web browser and navigate to [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net). This utility site will automate the process of creating a new Azure DevOps project within your account that is prepopulated with content (work items, repos, etc.) required for the lab. 

    > **Note**: For more information on the site, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/demo-gen.

1.  Click **Sign in** and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure DevOps subscription.
1.  If required, on the **Azure DevOps Demo Generator** page, click **Accept** to accept the permission requests for accessing your Azure DevOps subscription.
1.  On the **Create New Project** page, in the **New Project Name** textbox, type **Sharing Team Knowledge using Azure Project Wikis**, in the **Select organization** dropdown list, select your Azure DevOps organization, and then click **Choose template**.
1.  In the list of templates, select the **Tailwind Traders** template and click **Select Template**.
1.  Back on the **Create New Project** page, if prompted to install a missing extension, select the checkbox below the **ARM Outputs** and click **Create Project**.

    > **Note**: Wait for the process to complete. This should take about 2 minutes. In case the process fails, navigate to your Azure DevOps organization, delete the project, and try again.

1.  On the **Create New Project** page, click **Navigate to project**.

### Exercise 1: Publish code as wiki

In this exercise, you will step through publishing an Azure DevOps repository as wiki and managing the published wiki.

> **Note**: Content that you maintain in a Git repository can be published to an Azure DevOps wiki. For example, content written to support a software development kit, product documentation, or README files can be published directly to a wiki. You have the option of publishing multiple wikis within the same Azure DevOps team project.

#### Task 1: Publish a branch of an Azure DevOps repo as wiki
