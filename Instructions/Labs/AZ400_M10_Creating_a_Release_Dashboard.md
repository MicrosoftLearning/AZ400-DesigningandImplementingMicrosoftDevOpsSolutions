### Exercise 1: Create a release dashboard

In this exercise, you will create a release dashboard in an Azure DevOps organization.

#### Task 1: Create an Azure DevOps Starter resource

In this task, you will create an Azure DevOps Starter resource in your Azure subscription. This will automatically create a corresponding project in your Azure DevOps organization.

1.  On your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with the user account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.
1.  In the Azure portal, search for and select the **DevOps Starter** resource type and, on the **DevOps Starter** blade, click **+ Create**. 
1.  On the **DevOps Starter** blade, on the **Start fresh with a new application** pane, select the **.NET** tile and on the tops next to **Setting up DevOps starter with GitHub**, change settings, click **here** and select **Azure DevOps** , **Done** and **Next: Framework >**. 
1.  On the **DevOps Starter** blade, on the **Choose an application framework** pane, select the **ASP<nolink>.NET Core** tile, move the **Add a database** slider to the **On** position, and click **Next: Service >**. 
1.  On the **DevOps Starter** blade, on the **Select an Azure service to deploy the application** pane, ensure that the **Windows Web App** tile is selected and click **Next: Create >**. 
1.  On the **DevOps Starter** blade, on the **Almost there** pane, specify the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Project name | **Creating a Release Dashboard** |
    | Azure DevOps Organization | the name of the Azure DevOps organization you intend to use in this lab |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Web app name | any globally unique string between 2 and 60 characters consisting of letters, digits, and hyphens, starting and ending with either a letter or a digit |
    | Location | the name of Azure region into which you intend to deploy an Azure web app and an Azure SQL database |

1.  On the **DevOps Starter** blade, on the **Almost there** pane, click **Additional settings**.
1.  On the **Additional settings** pane, specify the following settings and click **OK**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Resource group | **az400m10l02-rg** |
    | Pricing tier | **F1 Free** |
    | Application Insights Location | the name of the same Azure region that you chose for the location of the Azure web app |
    | Server name | any globally unique string between 3 and 63 characters consisting of letters, digits, and hyphens, starting and ending with either a letter or a digit |
    | Enter username | **dbadmin** |
    | Location | the name of the same Azure region that you chose for the location of the Azure web app |
    | Database Name | **az400m10l02-db** |

1.  Back on the **DevOps Starter** blade, on the **Almost there** pane, click **Done** and then **Review + Create**.

    > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. The provisioning of the **DevOps Starter** resource should take about 2 minutes.

1.  Once you receive the confirmation that the DevOps Starter resource was provisioned, click the **Go to resource** button. This will redirect the browser to the DevOps Starter blade.
1.  On the DevOps Starter blade, track the progress of CI/CD pipeline until it completes successfully. 

    > **Note**: The creation of the corresponding Azure web app and Azure SQL database might take about 5 minutes. The process automatically creates an Azure DevOps project that includes a ready-to-deploy repository as well as the build and release pipelines. The Azure resources are created as part of the automatically triggered deployment pipeline. 

#### Task 2: Create Azure DevOps releases

In this task, you will create several Azure DevOps releases, including one that will result in a failed deployment.

1.  In the web browser displaying the Azure portal, on the DevOps Starter page, in the toolbar, click **Project homepage**. This will automatically open another browser tab displaying the **Creating a Release Dashboard** project in the Azure Devops portal. If prompted to sign in, authenticate with your Azure DevOps organization credentials.

    > **Note**: First, you will create a new release which will deploy successfully.

1.  In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical menu on the left side, click **Repos**, in the list of folders in the repository, navigate to the **Applications\\aspnet-core-dotnet-core\\Pages** folder and click the **Index.cshtml** entry. 
1.  On the **Index.cshtml** pane, click **Edit**, in line **20**, replace `<div class="description line-2"> Your ASP.NET Core app is up and running on Azure</div>` with `<div class="description line-2"> Your ASP.NET Core app v1.1 is up and running on Azure</div>` click **Commit**, and, on the **Commit** pane, click **Commit** again. This will automatically trigger the build pipeline. 
1.  In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane on the left side, click **Pipelines**.
1.  On the **Recent** tab of the **Pipelines** pane, click the **az400m10l02-CI** entry, on the **Runs** tab of the **az400m10l02-CI** pane, select the most recent run, on the **Summary** tab of the run, in the **Jobs** section, click **Build** and monitor the job until its successful completion. 
1.  Once the job completes, in the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane on the left side, in the **Pipelines** section, click **Releases**.
1.  On the **az400m10l02 - CD** pane, on the **Releases** tab, click the **Release-2** entry, on the **Pipeline** tab of the **Release-2** pane click the **dev** stage, on the **dev** pane, click **View logs**, and monitor progress of the deployment until its successful completion. 

    > **Note**: Now, you will create a new release which deployment will fail. The failure will be caused by built-in assemblies test, which consider the change associated with the new release to be invalid.

1.  In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical menu on the left side, click **Repos**, in the list of folders in the repository, navigate to the **Applications\\aspnet-core-dotnet-core\\Pages** folder and click the **Index.cshtml** entry. 
1.  On the **Index.cshtml** pane, click **Edit**, in line **4**, replace `    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page - ASP.NET Core";` with `    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page v1.2 - ASP.NET Core";` click **Commit**, and, on the **Commit** pane, click **Commit** again. This will automatically trigger the build pipeline. 
1.  In the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane on the left side, click **Pipelines**.
1.  On the **Recent** tab of the **Pipelines** pane, click the **az400m10l02-CI** entry, on the **Runs** tab of the **az400m10l02-CI** pane, select the most recent run, on the **Summary** tab of the run, in the **Jobs** section, click **Build** and monitor the job until its successful completion. 
1.  Once the job completes, in the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical navigational pane on the left side, in the **Pipelines** section, click **Releases**.
1.

    ```

1.  Review the output listed on the **Body** tab in the lower right section of the app window and verify that it includes only the failed deployment you initiated in the previous exercise of this lab.

### Exercise 3: Remove the Azure lab resources

In this exercise, you will remove the Azure resources provisione in this lab to eliminate unexpected charges. 

>**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

#### Task 1: Remove the Azure lab resources

In this task, you will use Azure Cloud Shell to remove the Azure resources provisioned in this lab to eliminate unnecessary charges. 

1.  In the Azure portal, open the **Bash** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1.  List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

    ```sh
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m10l02-rg')].name" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

    ```sh
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m10l02-rg')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
    ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the --nowait parameter), so while you will be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

#### Review

In this lab, you learned how to create and configure release dashboard and how to use REST API to retrieve Azure DevOps release data.
