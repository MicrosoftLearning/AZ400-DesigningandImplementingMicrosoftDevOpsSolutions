# Lab 12: Feature Flag Management with LaunchDarkly and Azure DevOps
# Student lab manual

## Lab overview

[**LaunchDarkly**](https://launchdarkly.com/) is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service. LaunchDarkly gives you the power to separate feature rollout from code deployment and manage feature flags at scale. Integration of LaunchDarkly with Azure DevOps minimizes potential risks associated with frequent releases. To further integrate releases with your development process, you can link feature flag roll-outs to Azure DevOps work items. 

In this lab, you will learn how to optimize management of feature flags in Azure DevOps by leveraging LaunchDarkly. 

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Create feature flags in LaunchDarkly
- Integrate LaunchDarkly with Web applications
- Automatically roll-out LaunchDarkly feature flags as part of Azure DevOps release pipelines

1.  In the list of templates, in the toolbar, click **DevOps Labs**, select the **LaunchDarkly** template and click **Select Template**.
1.  Back on the **Create New Project** page, if prompted to install a missing extension, select the checkbox below the **LaunchDarkly Integration V2** label and click **Create Project**

    > **Note**: Wait for the process to complete. This should take about 2 minutes. In case the process fails, navigate to your DevOps organization, delete the project, and try again.

1.  On the **Create New Project** page, click **Navigate to project**.

### Exercise 1: Configure feature flags in Azure DevOps by using LaunchDarkly

In this exercise, you will configure feature flags in Azure DevOps by using LaunchDarkly. 

#### Task 1: Create a feature flag in LaunchDarkly

In this task, you will create a feature flag in LaunchDarkly

1.  From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [LaunchDarkly web site](https://app.launchdarkly.com/), and sign in using your account. Your browser session will be redirected to the **Default Project** portal where you can create a feature flag. 
1.  In the LaunchDarkly portal, in the vertical menu bar on the left, click **Feature flags**.
1. On the **Feature flags** pane, click **Create FLAG**.
1.  On the **Create a feature flag** pane, in the **Name** text box, type **Member portal** and click the **SAVE FLAG** button.

    > **Note**: You've created a flag named **Member Portal**. Let's assume that you want to use this flag to determine the visibility of the **Member Portal** feature in your ASP.NET MVC web app. 

    > **Note**: To integrate LaunchDarkly into your application, you need an SDK key. 

1.  In the LaunchDarkly portal, in the vertical menu bar on the left, click **Account settings** and then click the **Projects** tab.

    > **Note**: On the **Projects** tab of the **Account settings** pane, you will find two predefined environments: **Production** and **Test**.  You can use the production environment SDK key for this project. 

1.  Record the SDK key for the production environment. You will need it later in this lab.

#### Task 2: Integrate LaunchDarkly in your Web application

In this task, you will integrate LaunchDarkly in your Web application.

1.  On your lab computer, switch to the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal with the **LaunchDarkly** project open and, in the lower left corner of the project pane, click **Project settings**.
1.  In the vertical menu bar titled **Project Settings**, in the **Repos** section, select **Repositories**.
1.  On the **All Repositories** pane, click **LaunchDarkly**, on the **Repository Settings** pane, verify that the **Commit mention linking** and **Commit mention work item resolution** settings are set to **On**.
1.  In the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, click **Repos** and verify that you are viewing the **Files** pane.

    > **Note**: In case the repo is empty, in the **Import a repository** section, select **Import**, on the **Import a Git repository** pane, in the **Clone URL** text box, enter `https://github.com/hsachinraj/PartsUnlimited.git`, and click **Import**.

1.  On the **Files** pane, click **Clone**.
1. On the **Clone Repository** pane, in the **IDE** drop-down list, select **Visual Studio**. If prompted, select **Open Microsoft Visual Studio Web Protocol Handler Selector**. This will automatically launch Visual Studio. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure DevOps subscription. 
1.  Within the Visual Studio window, in the **Azure DevOps** dialog box, click **Clone** and, if prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure DevOps subscription. 
1.  Within the Visual Studio window, click the top level **Git** menu, click **Local repositories**, click **Folder**, in the **Select Folder**, navigate to the local folder into which you cloned the LaunchDarkly repository, and click **Select Folder**.
1.  Within the Visual Studio window, click the top level **View** menu and, in the dropdown menu, click **Git Changes**. 
1. Within the Visual Studio window, at the top of the **Git Changes** pane, in the **master** dropdown list, click the down-pointing arrow head, in the drop-down dialog box, click **Remotes**, and, in the list of remote branches, select **origin/launch-darkly**. Select **Check out**. 

    > **Note**: This will automatically check out the **launch-darkly** branch. 

1.  Within the Visual Studio window, switch to the **Solution Explorer** window, and double-click **PartsUnlimited.sln** file to open the solution. 

    > **Note**: To integrate **LaunchDarkly** with .NET applications you need to install the NuGet package with the **LaunchDarkly client**. In the current project, that package has already been added for the ease of use.

1.  In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand the **PartsUnlimitedWebsite** node, right-click the **Dependencies** subnode, and, in the right-click menu, select the **Manage NuGet Packages** entry.
1.  In the **NuGet: PartsUnlimitedWebsite** pane, note that **LaunchDarkly.Client** is already installed.
1.  In the Visual Studio interface, in the top menu, click **IIS Express** to launch the application locally. 
1.  Verify that the application launches successfully in the local browser session and that the **Member Portal** section is present in the upper right corner of the web interface.

    > **Note**: Let's assume that this **Member Portal** module is a new feature and you would like to control it by using **LaunchDarkly feature flags**. This way, when you turn on the flag in LaunchDarkly, the feature should be visible to users.

1.  Close the web browser window displaying the web application interface.
1.  In the Visual Studio window, in the **Solution Explorer**, navigate to and open **PartsUnlimitedWebsite\\Controllers\\HomeController.cs**, replace its content with the code available at [the updated HomeController.cs code snippet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/azuredevopslabs/master/labs/vstsextend/launchdarkly/codesnippet/HomeController.cs), and save the change. 
1.  In the Visual Studio window, in the **Solution Explorer**, navigate to and open **PartsUnlimitedWebsite\\Controllers\\AccountController.cs**, replace its content with the code available at [the updated AccountController.cs code snippet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/azuredevopslabs/master/labs/vstsextend/launchdarkly/codesnippet/AccountController.cs), and save the change. 
1.  In the Visual Studio window, in the **Solution Explorer**, navigate to and open **PartsUnlimitedWebsite\\Views\Shared\\_Layout.chtml** and replace line 55 `@await Html.PartialAsync("_Login")` with the below code.

    ```cshtml
    @if (ViewBag.togglevalue == true)
    {
      @await Html.PartialAsync("_Login")
    }
    ```

1.  Switch to the tab displaying the content of the **Home Controller.cs** file and replace the placeholder `__YourLaunchDarklySDKKey__` in the line `static LdClient client = new LdClient("__YourLaunchDarklySDKKey__");` with the LaunchDarkly account SDK key which you copied in previous task of this exercise. 

    > **Note**: This will create an LdClient object with your environment-specific SDK key.

1.  Switch to the tab displaying the content of the **AccountController.cs** file and replace the placeholder `__YourLaunchDarklySDKKey__` in the line `static LdClient client = new LdClient("__YourLaunchDarklySDKKey__");` with the LaunchDarkly account SDK key which you copied in previous task of this exercise. 

    > **Note**: The above changes will result in the **HomeController** starting by initializing a static LaunchDarkly client. The methods to view **MemberPortal** are modified to check if the Feature flag toggle in LaunchDarkly is On or Off. The **_Layout.cshtml** page checks the toggle value and renders the MemberPortal link if the flag is turned on. 

1.  In the Visual Studio window, switch back to the **HomeController.cs** tab and review its content, focusing on the code between lines 57 and 74:

    ```
        //LaunchDarkly start
        User user = LaunchDarkly.Client.User.WithKey("administrator@test.com");
        bool value = client.BoolVariation("member-portal", user, false);
        if (value)
        {
          ViewBag.Message = "Your application description page.";
          ViewData["togglevalue"] = value;
          return View(viewModel);
        }
        else
        {
          return View(viewModel);
        }
        // return View(viewModel);

    }
    //LaunchDarkly End
    ```

    > **Note**: When you request a feature flag, you need to pass in a user object. So we are initializing user object in the beginning. This will be used to check whether a user with specified key exists in LaunchDarkly or not. In this sample, we have hardcoded the user value. In real-life scenarios, you could retrieve this value by identifying the logged in user or performing a database lookup.

    > **Note**: Then we are calling the **BoolVariation** method to the check feature flag value in LaunchDarkly. If the flag is true it will set **[ViewData["togglevalue"]** to true which is used in **_Layout.chtml** to view Member Portal module. If it is false it won't show Member Portal module.

    > **Note**: Similarly in **AccountController.cs** we have added LaunchDarkly code to **Login()** method which is responsible to show Login page once you click on **Member portal** icon. If the flag in LaunchDarkly is false, an HttpNotFound error will be returned for the Login page.

1. In the Visual Studio window, click **Save All** and click **IIS Express** to launch the application locally. If the **IIS Express** option isn't available, select the **Browser Link** option from the toolbar and select **Browser Link Dashboard**. From the dashboard select **View in browser**. 
1.  Verify that the **Member portal** link no longer appears in the web browser displaying the Parts Unlimited website, since the **MemberPortal** flag is, at this point, turned off .

    > **Note**: This implements the feature flag control using LaunchDarkly. You could now manually enable the toggle from the LaunchDarkly portal manually. However, in this lab, we will configure it via Azure DevOps Release pipeline using the LaunchDarkly extension. To include feature flags as part of the release process, we will associate this change with an Azure DevOps work item. 

1.  Close the web browser window displaying the web application interface.
1.  In the Visual Studio window, if needed, click the top level **View** menu and, in the dropdown menu, click **Team Explorer**.
1. In the **Team Explorer** pane, on the **Home** page, click **Work Items**. Select the link to view new hub if prompted.
1.  In the **Team Explorer** pane, on the **Work Items** page, note the single work item associated with this branch, including the work item ID. 
1.  Double-click the entry representing the work item. This will automatically open another web browser tab, displaying the work item in the Azure DevOps portal. 
1.  On the work item pane, verify that work item is assigned to you. 
1. Switch back to the Visual Studio window, navigate to the **Git Changes** pane, in the **Enter a message** textbox, type **Integated LaunchDarkly #<work\_item\_ID>**, where **<work\_item\_ID>** represents the ID you noted earlier, click the down-pointing arrow head next to the **Commit All** button, and, in the dropdown list, click **Commit All and Push**. If the **Commit All** is greyed out you can select the up arrow to perform the push. 

#### Task 3: Automatically rollout LaunchDarkly feature flags during release

In this task, you will configure automatic roll out of the LaunchDarkly feature flags during an Azure DevOps release

> **Note**: We need a LaunchDarkly access token to integrate with Azure DevOps services.
