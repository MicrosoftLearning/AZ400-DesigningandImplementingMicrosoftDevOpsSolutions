# Enable Dynamic Configuration and Feature Flags

## Lab requirements

- This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps supported browser.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/compatibility)

- **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops).

- Identify an existing Azure subscription or create a new one.

- Verify that you have a Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra account with the Contributor or the Owner role in the Azure subscription. For details, refer to [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal) and [View and assign administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

## Lab overview

[Azure App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a service to manage application settings and feature flags centrally. Modern programs, especially those running in a cloud, generally have many distributed components. Spreading configuration settings across these components can lead to hard-to-troubleshoot errors during application deployment. Use App Configuration to store all the settings for your application and secure their accesses in one place.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Enable dynamic configuration.
- Manage feature flags.

## Estimated timing: 45 minutes

## Instructions

### Exercise 0: (skip if done) Configure the lab prerequisites

In this exercise, you will set up the prerequisites for the lab, which consist of a new Azure DevOps project with a repository based on the [eShopOnWeb](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/eShopOnWeb).

#### Task 1: (skip if done) Create and configure the team project

In this task, you will create an **eShopOnWeb** Azure DevOps project to be used by several labs.

1. On your lab computer, in a browser window open your Azure DevOps organization. Click on **New Project**. Give your project the name **eShopOnWeb**, choose **Public** in the Visibility section and choose **Scrum** on the **Work Item process** dropdown. Click on **Create**.

#### Task 2: (skip if done) Import eShopOnWeb Git Repository

In this task you will import the eShopOnWeb Git repository that will be used by several labs.

1. On your lab computer, in a browser window open your Azure DevOps organization and the previously created **eShopOnWeb** project. Click on **Repos > Files** , **Import**. On the **Import a Git Repository** window, paste the following URL <https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/eShopOnWeb.git>  and click on **Import**:

1. The repository is organized the following way:
    - **.ado** folder contains Azure DevOps YAML pipelines.
    - **.devcontainer** folder container setup to develop using containers (either locally in VS Code or GitHub Codespaces).
    - **infra** folder contains Bicep&ARM infrastructure as code templates used in some lab scenarios.
    - **.github** folder container YAML GitHub workflow definitions.
    - **src** folder contains the .NET 8 website used on the lab scenarios.

#### Task 3: (skip if done) Set main branch as default branch

1. Go to **Repos > Branches**.
1. Hover on the **main** branch then click the ellipsis on the right of the column.
1. Click on **Set as default branch**.

### Exercise 1: (skip if done) Import and run CI/CD Pipelines

In this exercise, you will import CI/CD pipelines to build and deploy the eShopOnWeb application. The CI pipeline is already prepared to build the application and run tests. The CD pipeline will deploy the application to an Azure Web App.

#### Task 1: Import and run the CI pipeline

Let's start by importing the CI pipeline named [eshoponweb-ci.yml](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/eShopOnWeb/blob/main/.ado/eshoponweb-ci.yml).

1. Go to **Pipelines > Pipelines**.
1. Click on **Create Pipeline** button (if there are no pipelines) or **New pipeline** button (if there are already created pipelines).
1. Select **Azure Repos Git (Yaml)**.
1. Select the **eShopOnWeb** repository.
1. Select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML File**.
1. Select the **main** branch and the **/.ado/eshoponweb-ci.yml** file, then click on **Continue**.
1. Click the **Run** button to run the pipeline.
1. Your pipeline will take a name based on the project name. Let's **rename** it for identifying the pipeline better. Go to **Pipelines > Pipelines** and click on the recently created pipeline. Click on the ellipsis and **Rename/Remove** option. Name it **eshoponweb-ci** and click on **Save**.

#### Task 2: Import and run the CD pipeline

Let's import the CD pipeline named [eshoponweb-cd-webapp-code.yml](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/eShopOnWeb/blob/main/.ado/eshoponweb-cd-webapp-code.yml).

1. Go to **Pipelines > Pipelines**.
1. Click on **New pipeline** button.
1. Select **Azure Repos Git (Yaml)**.
1. Select the **eShopOnWeb** repository.
1. Select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML File**.
1. Select the **main** branch and the **/.ado/eshoponweb-cd-webapp-code.yml** file, then click on **Continue**.
1. In the YAML pipeline definition, customize:
   - **YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID** with your Azure subscription id.
   - **az400eshop-NAME** replace NAME to make it globally unique.
   - **AZ400-EWebShop-NAME** with the resource group name defined before in the lab.

1. Click on **Save and Run** and wait for the pipeline to execute successfully.

    > **Note**: You must click **Save and Run** twice. If the Jobs window displays a permission needed message, select **Deploy** from the Jobs window, select **View**, and then **Permit** twice to complete the pipeline run.

    > **Note**: The deployment may take a few minutes to complete.

    The CD definition consists of the following tasks:
    - **Resources**: it is prepared to automatically trigger based on CI pipeline completion. It also downloads the repository for the bicep file.
    - **AzureResourceManagerTemplateDeployment**: Deploys the Azure Web App using bicep template.

1. Your pipeline will take a name based on the project name. Let's **rename** it for identifying the pipeline better. Go to **Pipelines > Pipelines** and click on the recently created pipeline. Click on the ellipsis and **Rename/Remove** option. Name it **eshoponweb-cd-webapp-code** and click on **Save**.

### Exercise 2: Manage Azure App Configuration

In this exercise, you will create the App Configuration resource in Azure, enable the managed identity and then test the full solution.

> **Note**: This exercise doesn't require any coding skills. The website's code implements already Azure App Configuration functionalities.

If you want to know how to implement this in your application, please take a look at these tutorials: [Use dynamic configuration in an ASP.NET Core app](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/enable-dynamic-configuration-aspnet-core) and [Manage feature flags in Azure App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/manage-feature-flags).

#### Task 1: Create the App Configuration resource

1. In the Azure Portal, search for the **App Configuration** service
1. Click **Create app configuration** then select:
    - Your Azure Subscription.
    - The Resource Group created previously (it should be named **AZ400-EWebShop-NAME**).
    - The location.
    - A unique name like **appcs-NAME-REGION** for example.
    - Select the **Free** pricing tier.
1. Click on **Review + create** then **Create**.
1. After creating the App Configuration service, go to **Overview** and copy/save the value of the **Endpoint**.

#### Task 2: Enable Managed Identity

1. Go to the Web App deployed using the pipeline (it should be named **az400-webapp-NAME**).
1. In the **Settings** section, click on **Identity** then switch status to **On** in the **System Assigned** section, click **save > yes** and wait a few seconds for the operation to finish.
1. Go back to the App Configuration service and click on **Access control** then **Add role assignment**.
1. In the **Role** section, select **App Configuration Data Reader**.
1. In the **Members** section, check **Manage Identity**, then click **+ Select members**. In the **Managed Identity** field, select **App Service (1)**, select your app service, then click **Select**.
1. Click on **Review and assign** twice to complete the role assignment.

#### Task 3: Configure the Web App

In order to make sure that your website is accessing App Configuration, you need to update its configuration.

1. Go back to your Web App.
1. In the **Settings** section, click on **Environment Variables**.
1. Add two new application settings:
    - First app setting
        - **Name:** UseAppConfig
        - **Value:** true
    - Second app setting
        - **Name:** AppConfigEndpoint
        - **Value:** *the value you saved/copied previously from App Configuration Endpoint. It should look like <https://appcs-NAME-REGION.azconfig.io>*

1. Click **Apply** then **Confirm** and wait for the settings to be updated.
1. Go to **Overview** and click on **Browse**
1. At this step, you will see no changes in the website since the App Configuration doesn't contain any data. This is what you will do in the next tasks.

#### Task 4: Test the Configuration Management

1. In your website, select **Visual Studio** in the **Brand** drop-down list and click on the arrow button (**>**).
1. You will see a message saying *"THERE ARE NO RESULTS THAT MATCH YOUR SEARCH"*. The goal of this Lab is to be able to update that value without updating the website's code or redeploying it.
1. In order to try this, go back to App Configuration.
1. In the **Operations** section, select **Configuration Explorer**.
1. Click on **Create > Key-value** then add:
    - **Key:** eShopWeb:Settings:NoResultsMessage
    - **Value:** *type your custom message*
1. Click **Apply** then go back to your website and refresh the page.
1. You should see your new message instead of the old default value.

#### Task 5: Test the Feature Flag

Let's continue to test the Feature manager.

1. In order to try this, go back to App Configuration.
1. In the **Operations** section, select **Feature manager**.
1. Click on **Create** then add:
    - **Enable feature flag:** Checked
    - **Feature flag name:** SalesWeekend
1. Click **Apply** then go back to your website and refresh the page.
1. You should see an image with text "ALL T-SHIRTS ON SALE THIS WEEKEND".
1. You can disable this feature in App Configuration and then you would see that the image disappears.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Remember to delete the resources created in the Azure portal to avoid unnecessary charges. Be sure to disable the **eshoponweb-cd-webapp-code** pipeline or it will re-create a deleted resource group and associated resources after the next run of **eshoponweb-ci**.

## Review

In this lab, you learned how to dynamically enable configuration and manage feature flags.
