# Lab 16: Deploying a multi-container application to Azure Kubernetes Services
# Student lab manual

## Lab overview

[**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) is the quickest way to use Kubernetes on Azure. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** manages your hosted Kubernetes environment, making it straightforward to deploy and manage containerized applications without requiring container orchestration expertise. It also enhances agility, scalability, and availability of your containerized workloads. Azure DevOps further streamlines AKS operations by providing continuous build and deployment capabilities. 

In this lab, you will use Azure DevOps to deploy a containerized ASP.NET Core web application **MyHealthClinic** (MHC) to an AKS cluster. 

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Create an Azure DevOps team project with a .NET Core application using the Azure DevOps Demo Generator tool.
- Use Azure CLI to create an Azure Container registry (ACR), an AKS cluster and an Azure SQL database
- Configure containerized application and database deployment by using Azure DevOps
- Use Azure DevOps pipelines to build to automatically deploy containerized applications

    ```

    >**Note**: Record both values. You will need them in the next task.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 2: Configure the build and release pipelines

In this task, you will configure the build and release pipelines in the Azure DevOps project you generated earlier in this lab, by mapping Azure resources, including the AKS cluster and Azure Container registry to the build and release definitions.

1.  On your lab computer, switch to the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal with the **Deploying a multi-container application to AKS** project open, in the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, click **Repos**.

    >**Note**: You will first modify the references to the Docker image.

1.  On the **AKS** repository pane, in the list of files, select **docker-compose.ci.build.yml**.
1.  On the **docker-compose.ci.build.yml** pane, click **Edit**, replace line **5** that references the target Docker image with `image: az400mp/aspnetcore-build:1.0-2.0`, select **Commit** and, when prompted for confirmation, click **Commit** again. 
1.  On the **AKS** repository pane, in the list of files, navigate to the **src/MyHealth.Web** folder and select **Dockerfile**.
1.  On the **Dockerfile** pane, click **Edit**, replace line **1** that references the base Docker image with `FROM az400mp/aspnetcore1.0:1.0.4`, select **Commit** and, when prompted for confirmation, click **Commit** again. 
1.  In the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal with the **Deploying a multi-container application to AKS** project open, in the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, click **Pipelines**.

    >**Note**: You will now modify the build pipeline.

1.  On the **Pipelines** pane, under **All** option, click the entry representing the **MyHealth.AKS.build** pipeline and, on the **MyHealth.AKS.build** pane, click **Edit**.

1.  On the **MyHealth.AKS.build** pipeline pane, ensure that the **Pipeline** entry is selected and, in the **Agent Specifications** drop-down list, select **ubuntu-18.04**.
1.  In the list of tasks of the pipeline, click the **Replace tokens in appsettings.json** task, in the **Token pattern** dropdown list select ```__...__``` . 
1.  In the list of tasks of the pipeline, click the **Run services** task, on the **Docker Compose** pane on the right side, in the **Azure subscription** dropdown list, select the entry representing the Azure subscription you are using in this lab, and click **Authorize** to create the corresponding service connection. When prompted, sign in using the account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription and the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with the Azure subscription.

    >**Note**: Wait for the authorization process to complete. This step creates an Azure service connection, which defines and secures a connection to the target Azure subscription, using Service Principal Authentication (SPA). 

1.  In the list of tasks of the pipeline, with the **Run services** task selected, on the **Docker Compose** pane on the right side, in the **Azure Container Registry** dropdown list, select the entry representing the ACR instance you created earlier in this lab. 
     >**Note**: **Refresh** the list if needed and choose previously created ACR. **If no option is shown, type the full ACR name: ACRNAME.azurecr.io**).
1.  Repeat the previous two steps to configure the **Azure subscription** (next time do not Authorize again, use the created **Available Azure service connections** ) and **Azure Container Registry** settings in the **Build services**, **Push services**, and **Lock services** tasks, but instead of selecting your Azure subscription in this case, select the newly created service connection. 

    >**Note**: The pipeline consists of the following tasks

    | Tasks | Usage |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | **Replace tokens** | replace a placeholder with the name of the ACR in the database connection string in the **appsettings.json** file and in the **mhc-aks.yaml** manifest file |
    | **Run services** |  prepares the environment by pulling required images, such as aspnetcore-build:1.0-2.0 and restoring packages referenced in **.csproj** |
    | **Build services** |  builds the Docker images specified in the **docker-compose.yml** file and tags images with the **$(Build.BuildId)** and **latest** tags |
    | **Push services** |  pushes the Docker image **myhealth.web** to Azure Container Registry |
    | **Publish Build Artifacts** |  publishes **mhc-aks.yaml** & **myhealth.dacpac** files to the artifact drop location in Azure DevOps so that they can be used in the subsequent release |

    >**Note**: The **appsettings.json** file contains details of the database connection string used to connect to the Azure SQL database, which you created earlier in this lab. The **mhc-aks.yaml** manifest file contains configuration details of **deployments**, **services** and **pods** which will be deployed in Azure Kubernetes Service. For more information regarding deployment manifests, refer to [AKS Deployments and YAML manifests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads#deployments-and-yaml-manifests)
1.  In the list of the **Pipeline variables**, update the values of the **ACR** and **SQLserver** variables with the values you recorded at the end of the previous task (SQLPassword is **P2ssw0rd1234**, SQLuser is **sqladmin**, SQLdatabase is **mhcdb**), then click the down-facing caret next to the **Save & queue** button, click **Save** to save the changes, and, when prompted again, click **Save**.
1.  In the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, in the **Pipelines** section, click **Releases**. 
1.  On the **Pipelines / Releases** pane, select the **MyHealth.AKS.Release** entry and click **Edit**.

1.  On the **Kubectl** pane on the right side, in the **Azure Subscription** dropdown list, select the entry representing the same Azure service connection, in the **Resource group** dropdown list, select the **az400m16l01a-RG** entry, and in the **Kubernetes cluster** dropdown list, select the entry representing the AKS cluster you deployed earlier in this lab.
1.  In the list of tasks of the **Dev** stage, in the **AKS deployment** job section, with the **Create Deployments & Services in AKS** task selected, on the **Kubectl** pane on the right side, scroll down to and expand the **Secrets** section, in the **Azure subscription** dropdown list, select the entry representing the same Azure service connection, and, in the **Azure container registry** dropdown list, select the entry representing the Azure Container registry you created earlier in this lab.
1.  Repeat the two previous steps for the **Update image in AKS** task.

    >**Note**: The **Create Deployments & Services in AKS** task will create the required deployments and services in AKS as per the configuration specified in **mhc-aks.yaml** file. The pod will pull the latest Docker image.

    >**Note**: The **Update image in AKS** task will pull the required image corresponding to the BuildID from the designated repository and deploy that image to the **mhc-front pod** running in AKS.

    >**Note**: A secret called **mysecretkey** is created in AKS cluster through Azure DevOps by using command `kubectl create secret` in the background. This secret will be used to authorize access to the Azure Container Registry in order to pull the myhealth.web image.

1.  On the **Tasks** pane of the **Dev** stage of the **MyHealth.AKS.Release** release pipeline, click the **Variables** tab. 
1.  In the list of the **Pipeline variables**, update the value of the **ACR** variable to the Azure Container Registry name you recorded at the end of the previous task. 
1.  In the list of the **Pipeline variables**, update the values of the **SQLserver** variable to the name of the logical server you recorded at the end of the previous task (SQLPassword is **P2ssw0rd1234**, SQLuser is **sqladmin**, SQLdatabase is **mhcdb**). 
1.  In the upper right corner of the **All pipelines / MyHealth.AKS.Release** pane, click **Save**, and, when prompted, click **Save** again to save the changes.

    >**Note**: In the list of pipeline variables, **DatabaseName** is set to **mhcdb**, **SQLuser** is set to **sqladmin**, and **SQLpassword** is set to **P2ssw0rd1234**. If you entered different values when creating the Azure SQL database earlier in this lab, update the values of the variables accordingly.

#### Task 3: Trigger the build and release pipelines

In this task, you will trigger the build and release pipelines and validate their completion.

1.  In the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal, in the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, in the **Pipelines** section, click **Pipelines**. 
1.  On the **Pipelines** pane, **All** option, select the **MyHealth.AKS.build** pipeline, on the **MyHealth.AKS.build** pane, click **Run pipeline**, and, on the **Run pipeline** pane, click **Run**.
1.  On the build pipeline run pane, in the **Jobs** section, click **Phase 1** and monitor the progress of the build process.

    >**Note**: The build will generate and push the Docker image to ACR. After the build completes, you can review the build summary. 

1.  To review the generated images, switch to the web browser window displaying the Azure portal.
1.  In the Azure portal, search for and select the **Container registries** resource type and, on the **Container registries** blade, select the Azure Container registry you created earlier in this lab.
1.  On the Azure Container registry blade, in the **Services** section, click **Repositories** and verify that the list of repositories includes the **myhealth.web** entry.
1.  Switch back to the web browser window displaying the Azure DevOps portal.
1.  In the vertical menu bar at the far left of the Azure DevOps portal, in the **Pipelines** section, click **Releases** and, on the **MyHealth.AKS.Release** blade, click the latest release, and select the **In progress** link to monitor the progress of the release.
1.  Once the release is complete, switch to the web browser window displaying the Azure portal.
1.  In the Azure portal, in the toolbar, click the **Cloud Shell** icon located directly to the right of the search text box. 
1.  From the Bash session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to gain access to the AKS cluster you deployed earlier in this lab:

    ```bash
    RGNAME=az400m16l01a-RG
    AKSNAME=$(az aks list --resource-group $RGNAME --query '[].name' --output tsv)
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RGNAME --name $AKSNAME
    ```

1.  From the Bash session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list the pods running in AKS that were deployed by using the release pipeline:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```

1.  From the Bash session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list the load balancer service that provides an external IP address via which you can access the containerized application:

    ```bash
    kubectl get service mhc-front --watch
    ```

    >**Note**: Our application is designed to be deployed in the pod with the load balancer service providing external connectivity. 

1.  Note the value of the IP address in the **External-IP** column in the output of the command, open a new web browser tab, browse to that IP address, and verify that the **MyHealthClinic** application is running.

    >**Note**: Kubernetes includes a web dashboard that can be used for basic management operations. This dashboard lets you view basic health status and metrics for your applications, create and deploy services, and edit existing applications. Follow [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-dashboard) to access the Kubernetes web dashboard in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### Exercise 2: Remove the Azure lab resources

In this exercise, you will remove the Azure resources provisioned in this lab to eliminate unexpected charges. 

>**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

#### Task 1: Remove the Azure lab resources

In this task, you will use Azure Cloud Shell to remove the Azure resources provisioned in this lab to eliminate unnecessary charges. 

1.  In the Azure portal, open the **Bash** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1.  List all resource groups created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

    ```sh
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m16l01a-RG')].name" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

    ```sh
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az400m16l01a-RG')].[name]" --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
    ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the --nowait parameter), so while you will be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

## Review

In this lab, you learned how to use Azure DevOps to deploy a containerized ASP.NET Core web application **MyHealthClinic** (MHC) to an AKS cluster.
